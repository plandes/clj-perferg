Convert PerfProStudio files to ERG mode files, which is used for trainers like
the WahooKickr.  I use [iMobileIntervals](http://imobileintervals.com), which
takes
[ERG](http://support.trainerroad.com/hc/en-us/articles/201869764-Erg-Mode-Explained) file
forms.  However, my coach exports files
as [PerfPro (.ppsmrx)](http://perfprostudio.com).  This utility converts to an
ERG file and also optionally provides and Excel summary file.


## Obtaining

The latest release binaries are
available [here](https://github.com/plandes/clj-perferg/releases/latest).

### Source

In your `project.clj` file, add:

[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.tools/erg/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.tools/erg/)


## Usage

The app needs a `-p` for the `.ppsmrx` PerfPro file and
your [FTP](https://wattbike.com/us/functional-threshold-power).  You can
optionally provide `-e` and use `-h` to get a usage.

```bash
$ pp2erg -p Bike\ Climb\ 3\ \(4x4\)\ +\ \(4x1\)\ min.ppsmrx -f 244 -e
perferg: perfpro: processing Bike Climb 3 (4x4) + (4x1) min.ppsmrx with ftp 244
perferg: perfpro: wrote: Bike Climb 3 (4x4) + (4x1) min.erg
perferg: perfpro: wrote: Bike Climb 3 (4x4) + (4x1) min.xls
```

Usage:
```sql
$ pp2erg --help
usage: pp2erg [options]
Convert a perfpro .ppsmrx file to .erg and optionally .xls
  -l, --level <log level>     INFO  Log level to set in the Log4J2 system.
  -p, --perfpro <file>              The PerfPro .ppsmrx file input file
  -e, --excel                       If provided output an Excel summary file as well
  -f, --ftp <number>                The functional threshold power
  -i, --interpolate <number>  4.5   zone to percent FTP interplation constant
```

## Todo

* Currently the tool doesn't support individual zones--that's next.
* Add option to parse FTP description matches (i.e. *"seated climb 75% FTP"*
  gets an FTP of 75%.
